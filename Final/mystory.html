      <li>As a child, we didn't have a computer at all so I had no idea what exactly computer was.</li>
      <li>In high school, I took basic computer class which was one of the mandatory classes.</li>
      <li>Back then I wasn't interested in knowing more about computers rather than just being able to type faster than my classmates because it seemed very hard thing to learn.</li>
      <li>When my math teacher voluntarily taught how to make games using computers, I have always used to wonder, “How? How do they do all these animations and build websites?”</li>
      <li>I started wondering if I will be able to program one day and since then my interest about computer started to develop.</li>
      <li>Now, thanks to our wonderful teacher Brenton Strine and all the Teacher Assistants, I am learning how to code to build a website!</li>
      <li>I am loving this course so much I just want to code all the time! It's very interesting stuff!!</li><!-- And you are doing so great!!! :) ~Julie -->
