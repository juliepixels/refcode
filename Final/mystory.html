      <li>I was born and raised in Harar, Ethiopia. As a child, we didn't have a computer at all so I had no idea what exactly computer was.</li>
      <li>My siblings, our dad, and I migrated to Canada in 2006. In high school, I took basic computer class which was one of the mandatory classes.</li>
      <li>With no knowledge about computer and how it functions, that computer class just put me in competition. I was trying and trying to type faster as they were or even better.</li>
      <li>I typed all driving permit questions from the book to the computer, and any book that is availabe around me. In short amount of time, I was as fast typer as my classmates were!</li>
      <li>When my math teacher voluntarily taught how to make games using computers, I have always used to wonder how they do all those animations, the coding language that looks cool on the computer screen, and build any websites?</li>
      <li>I started wondering if I will be able to program one day, and since then my interest about computer started to develop.</li>
      <li>Now, thanks to our wonderful teacher Brenton Strine and all the Teacher Assistants, I am learning how to code to build a website!</li>
      <li>Now I don't feel like am all oblivious about those pretty codes I used to see on the screen.</li>
      <li>I am loving this course so much I just want to code all the time! It's very interesting stuff!!</li>
